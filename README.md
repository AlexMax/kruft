kruft
=====
My personal collection of functions used for working on crufty C and C++
codebases that can't be rewritten all at once.

- Permissively licensed.
- Implementations prefer clarity over cleverness.
- Properly namespaced.
- Easy to drop into your own project.
- Support nice language and compiler features & annotations when available.
