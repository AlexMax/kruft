kruft
=====
My personal collection of functions used for working on crufty C and C++
codebases that can't be rewritten all at once.

- Support C89 and C++98 compilers, and possibly a few older fossils.
- Support C++11 `constexpr` when possible.
- Implementations prefer clarity over cleverness.
- No dependencies except compiler headers and libc.
- Very few transitive header dependencies.
- If you want to copy and paste an implementation, converting kruft's defines
  and types to your project's equivalents should be trivial.
- Extensively tested.
- Permissively licensed; only source-code attribution required.
